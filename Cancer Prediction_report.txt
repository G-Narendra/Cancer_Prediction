Objective
To classify breast cancer as malignant or benign using diagnostic measurements and logistic regression.

Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises 569 entries with features like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. The target variable is the diagnosis (M for malignant, B for benign).

Methodology
Data Import and Exploration:

Loaded the dataset and checked its structure and summary statistics.
Data Preprocessing:

Defined the target variable (y as diagnosis) and predictors (X excluding id and Unnamed: 32).
Train-Test Split:

Split data into 70% training and 30% testing sets.
Model Selection and Training:

Chose and trained a logistic regression model with a maximum of 5000 iterations.
Model Prediction:

Predicted the diagnosis on the test set.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model using confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report.
