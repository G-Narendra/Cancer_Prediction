Introduction to the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is titled "Cancer." It contains information about 569 instances of breast cancer, including various diagnostic measurements. The dataset includes the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for each instance.
diagnosis: Diagnosis of breast cancer (M = malignant, B = benign).
radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, etc.: Various diagnostic measurements of the cell nuclei present in the digitized image of a breast mass.
Unnamed: 32: A column with no data (to be excluded).
Project Description
The project aims to develop a predictive model to classify breast cancer as either malignant or benign based on diagnostic measurements. This involves the following steps:

Data Import and Exploration: Load the dataset and perform initial data inspection.
Data Preprocessing: Define the target variable y (diagnosis) and features X (all other relevant columns).
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
Model Selection and Training: Use logistic regression to train the model on the training data.
Model Prediction: Predict the diagnosis for the test data.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report.
This project provides insights into how different diagnostic measurements influence the prediction of breast cancer and helps in making data-driven classifications.
